<h1>A french student PHP project</h1>

In order to pass the Superior Technician License, the team which I'm a member of needs to produce a complete fonctional network, website, wifi access point and dynamic display (magic mirror).

<strong>Here is the website repository made to perform a quick update of the website directory onto the webserver hosting the website and the associated database.</strong>

The website scritps may have some bugs and may be incomplete but the updates will come as soon as possible.
